## Model Comparison

### ORIGINAL (INCORRECT) FLOW
```
User receives email
  ↓
User clicks link
  ↓
User views shared document
  ↓
❌ User must click "Clone to My Vault"
  ↓
❌ User edits THEIR COPY
  ↓
❌ Original unchanged - NOT collaborative
```

### REFACTORED (GOOGLE DOCS) FLOW
```
User receives email
  ↓
User clicks link (redirects to login if needed)
  ↓
✅ Document IMMEDIATELY appears in "Shared with Me"
  ↓
User opens document
  ↓
If "edit" permission: ✅ User edits ORIGINAL directly
If "read" permission: ✅ User views ORIGINAL (read-only)
  ↓
✅ Changes save to original, all collaborators see updates
  ↓
Clone is OPTIONAL (context menu)
```

## Key Architectural Clarifications

### 1. System "Shared with Me" Folio

**Original:** Vague mention, no implementation details

**Refactored:**
- Created automatically on user signup
- `isSystem: true` flag in database
- Cannot be deleted (403 error)
- Cannot be renamed (403 error)
- Migration script for existing users
- Utility function: `createSystemFoliosForUser()`

### 2. When Does Document Appear?

**Original:** Unclear, mentions "first access with token"

**Refactored:**
- **If recipient exists:** PageCollaborator created IMMEDIATELY when share is sent
- **If recipient doesn't exist:** PageCollaborator created when they access link
- NO user action required
- Document visible in FileNavigator instantly

### 3. Authentication Gate

**Original:** Mentioned but not detailed

**Refactored:**
- 5-step flow documented
- Token preservation through login
- Redirect to: `/login?callbackUrl=/public/[slug]?token=[token]`
- After auth: Redirect back with token
- Validation: Check session AND token

### 4. Collaborative Editing

**Original:** Unclear permission checks

**Refactored:**
- Permission check: owner OR PageCollaborator with 'editor' role
- Direct editing of ORIGINAL document
- Collaboration banner in editor
- Author attribution tracked
- Last-write-wins conflict resolution

### 5. Clone Feature

**Original:** Required for collaboration

**Refactored:**
- OPTIONAL feature
- Accessed via right-click context menu
- Creates independent copy
- User has both: access to original + clone
- Clone is NOT collaborative

## Dev Notes Quality

### Original Dev Notes Issues:
- Scattered across file
- Mixed with implementation logs
- Repeated information
- 2000+ lines with lots of noise
- Hard to find specific guidance

### Refactored Dev Notes Benefits:
- ONE comprehensive section
- Clear subsections:
  - Architecture Overview
  - Database Schema
  - System Folio
  - Authentication Gate
  - Immediate Access Model
  - Collaborative Editing
  - Clone Feature
  - Email Integration
  - File Paths
  - Testing Checklist
  - Coding Standards
  - Common Pitfalls
- ~600 focused lines
- Self-contained (developer doesn't need to read architecture docs)

---

## Task Quality

### Original Tasks Problems:
- Mixed abstraction levels
- Some too vague ("Implement sharing")
- Some too detailed (full code snippets)
- Duplicates and contradictions
- No clear sequence

### Refactored Tasks Benefits:
- 15 sequential tasks
- Each 1-4 hours
- Clear inputs/outputs
- Implementable in one session
- Follows dependency order:
  1. Database (foundation)
  2. System folio (infrastructure)
  3. Tokens (security)
  4. Email (communication)
  5. APIs (backend)
  6. Auth gate (access control)
  7. UI (frontend)
  8. Testing (validation)

---

## Acceptance Criteria Organization

### Original:
- Flat list of 60+ criteria
- No grouping
- Some overlap
- Mixed priorities

### Refactored:
- Organized by feature area:
  1. System Folio (8 criteria)
  2. Sharing Levels & Auth (10 criteria)
  3. Share Management (11 criteria)
  4. Immediate Access (8 criteria)
  5. Read-Only Sharing (8 criteria)
  6. Edit Permissions (10 criteria)
  7. Clone Capability (12 criteria)
  8. Security & Privacy (7 criteria)
  9. User Experience (8 criteria)

## What Developer Gets

### From Original File:
- Confused about model (clone vs. collaborative)
- Overwhelmed by 3500 lines
- Has to hunt for architecture details
- Unclear what's implemented vs. planned
- Mixed signals on requirements

### From Refactored File:
- ✅ Crystal clear: Google Docs model
- ✅ Manageable 1200 lines
- ✅ All architecture in Dev Notes section
- ✅ Clean slate: Status "Draft"
- ✅ Unambiguous requirements
- ✅ Step-by-step implementation guide
- ✅ Can start Task 1 immediately

## Bottom Line

| Aspect | Original | Refactored |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Clarity** | 3/10 | 10/10 |
| **Implementability** | 4/10 | 10/10 |
| **Completeness** | 7/10 | 10/10 |
| **Organization** | 3/10 | 10/10 |
| **Alignment with Google Docs Model** | 2/10 | 10/10 |

**Recommendation:** Use refactored version as canonical Story 3.2.
