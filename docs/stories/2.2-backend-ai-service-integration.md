# Story 2.2: Backend AI Service Integration

**Status:** Draft

## User Story

As a developer, I want to establish a secure connection to our chosen AI service, so that the application can send text for processing.

## Description

This story implements the backend infrastructure for connecting to Google Vertex AI, ensuring UK/EU data residency compliance. It includes API route setup, authentication, error handling, and a basic test endpoint to verify the connection is working.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A Next.js API route is created for AI service requests
- [ ] The API route successfully connects to Google Vertex AI Europe endpoint
- [ ] All requests and data processing occur within UK/EU regions (GDPR compliant)
- [ ] Proper error handling is implemented for API failures
- [ ] Authentication and API key management is secure (using environment variables)
- [ ] A test endpoint verifies the AI connection is working
- [ ] Rate limiting and basic security measures are in place
