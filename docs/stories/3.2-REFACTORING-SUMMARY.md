# Story 3.2 Refactoring Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Original File:** `3.2-collaborative-sharing-permissions.md` (3467 lines)
**Refactored File:** `3.2-collaborative-sharing-permissions-REFACTORED.md` (1239 lines)
**Reduction:** 64% shorter, more focused and implementable

---

## What Changed

### 1. Clarity of Requirements

**Original Issues:**
- Contained implementation details mixed with requirements
- Had extensive Dev Agent Record sections (1000+ lines of completed work)
- Multiple contradictory sections due to iterative development
- Unclear architectural intent

**Refactored Improvements:**
- âœ… Clear separation: User Story â†’ Acceptance Criteria â†’ Tasks â†’ Dev Notes
- âœ… All Google Docs model requirements explicitly stated upfront
- âœ… Removed completed implementation logs
- âœ… Single source of truth for architecture

### 2. Google Docs Model Emphasis

**Critical Changes:**
- ðŸš¨ **IMMEDIATE ACCESS MODEL**: Documents appear in "Shared with Me" folio automatically
- ðŸš¨ **NO CLONE REQUIRED**: Users access ORIGINAL documents directly
- ðŸš¨ **COLLABORATIVE EDITING**: Edit permission = direct edit of original
- ðŸš¨ **CLONE IS OPTIONAL**: Separate feature accessed via context menu

**Key Architectural Clarifications:**
1. System "Shared with Me" folio created on user signup
2. PageCollaborator record created immediately when share is created (if recipient exists)
3. Authentication gate redirects to login while preserving token
4. FileNavigator queries PageCollaborator to show shared documents
5. Note editing APIs check: owner OR has PageCollaborator with 'editor' role

### 3. Task Breakdown

**Original:**
- 18+ tasks with varying levels of detail
- Some tasks duplicated or contradictory
- Tasks mixed "what" with "how"

**Refactored:**
- 15 clear, sequential tasks
- Each task is implementable in one focused session (1-4 hours)
- Tasks follow logical implementation order:
  1. Database schema (foundation)
  2. System folio creation (critical infrastructure)
  3. Token utilities (security layer)
  4. Email service (communication)
  5. API endpoints (backend logic)
  6. Authentication gate (access control)
  7. FileNavigator updates (UI for shared docs)
  8. Context menu for clone (optional feature)
  9. Collaborative editing permissions (core feature)
  10. Share management UI (owner control)
  11. Integration testing
  12. Documentation

### 4. Dev Notes Enhancement

**Original Dev Notes:**
- Scattered throughout file
- Repeated information
- Mixed with implementation logs

**Refactored Dev Notes:**
- âœ… Comprehensive architecture overview at start
- âœ… Three-tiered access model clearly explained
- âœ… Database schema with complete field definitions
- âœ… System folio implementation details
- âœ… Authentication gate step-by-step flow
- âœ… Immediate access model explained
- âœ… Collaborative editing implementation guidance
- âœ… Clone as optional feature clarified
- âœ… File paths for all key locations
- âœ… Testing checklist
- âœ… Coding standards compliance reminders
- âœ… Common pitfalls to avoid

**All information Developer needs is in ONE section.**

### 5. Acceptance Criteria Refinement

**Original:**
- 60+ criteria, some overlapping
- Mix of technical and user-facing criteria
- Unclear priority

**Refactored:**
- 58 focused criteria organized by feature area:
  - System Folio (8 criteria)
  - Sharing Levels & Authentication (10 criteria)
  - Share Creation & Management (11 criteria)
  - Immediate Access (8 criteria)
  - Read-Only Sharing (8 criteria)
  - Edit Permissions (10 criteria)
  - Clone Capability (12 criteria)
  - Security & Privacy (7 criteria)
  - User Experience (8 criteria)

**Each criterion is:**
- âœ… Testable
- âœ… Unambiguous
- âœ… Aligned with Google Docs model
- âœ… Not implementation-specific

### 6. File Structure

**Original Structure:**
```
- Header (Status, Epic, Dependencies)
- ðŸš¨ CRITICAL warnings
- User Story
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria
- Tasks (mixed with completed logs)
- Dev Notes (scattered, 2000+ lines)
- Implementation Records
- Bug Fixes
- QA Notes
```

**Refactored Structure:**
```
- Header (Status: Draft, Epic, Dependencies)
- User Story (clear, concise)
- Description (three-tiered model explained)
- Acceptance Criteria (organized by feature)
- Tasks (15 implementable tasks)
- Dev Notes (comprehensive, ONE section):
  - Architecture Overview
  - Database Schema
  - System Folio Details
  - Authentication Gate
  - Immediate Access Model
  - Collaborative Editing
  - Clone Feature
  - Email Integration
  - File Paths
  - Testing Checklist
  - Coding Standards
  - Common Pitfalls
  - Dependencies
  - Future Enhancements
  - Dev Agent Record (empty, for developer to fill)
```

## Key Architectural Decisions Clarified

### Decision 1: When is PageCollaborator Created?

**Clarified:** PageCollaborator is created in TWO scenarios:
1. **Immediately when share is created** - IF recipient already has an Edfolio account
2. **On first access with valid token** - IF recipient doesn't have account yet

This ensures:
- Existing users see shared docs immediately
- New users see shared docs after signup
- No manual "accept" step required

### Decision 2: How Does FileNavigator Show Shared Documents?

**Clarified:** FileNavigator queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM PageCollaborator
WHERE userId = currentUser.id
```

Then for each PageCollaborator:
- Fetch associated PublishedPage
- Fetch Page title and metadata
- Display in "Shared with Me" system folio

### Decision 3: How is Collaborative Editing Enabled?

**Clarified:** Note editing API permission check changes from:
```typescript
// BEFORE
if (note.folioId !== userFolioId) return 403;

// AFTER
const isOwner = note.folioId === userFolioId;
const isEditor = await PageCollaborator.findFirst({
  where: { pageId: note.publishedPageId, userId, role: 'editor' }
});
if (!isOwner && !isEditor) return 403;
```

### Decision 4: System Folio Protection

**Clarified:** Two-part protection:
1. **Database level**: `isSystem: true` flag
2. **API level**: DELETE and PATCH endpoints check flag and return 403

### Decision 5: Clone vs. Collaboration

**Clarified:**
- **Collaboration**: Default behavior, access original document
- **Clone**: Optional action via context menu, creates independent copy
- Both can coexist: user has access to original + their clone

## What Was Removed

### Removed from Original File:

1. **Completed Implementation Logs** (1000+ lines)
   - Dev Agent Record sections with completed work
   - QA test results
   - Bug fix histories

2. **Duplicate/Contradictory Sections** (500+ lines)
   - Multiple versions of requirements
   - Overlapping task definitions
   - Repeated architectural explanations

3. **Overly Detailed Implementation Code** (300+ lines)
   - Complete code snippets in tasks
   - Specific function implementations
   - Database query examples

4. **Status Change Logs** (200+ lines)
   - History of status changes
   - Multiple "CRITICAL UPDATE" sections
   - Iteration notes

**Total Removed:** ~2000 lines of noise

**Why Removed:**
- Developer doesn't need completed work history
- Story should be implementation-agnostic
- Dev Notes should guide, not prescribe exact code

   - Visual distinction in Description

2. **Immediate Access Architecture**
   - Step-by-step flow
   - Database query patterns
   - UI update logic

3. **Authentication Gate Flow**

   - Migration script requirements
   - API protection logic

5. **Comprehensive Testing Checklist**
   - System folio tests
   - Sharing flow tests
   - Authentication tests
   - Immediate access tests
   - Collaborative editing tests
   - Clone feature tests
   - Permission management tests

## Migration Path

### For Developer Agent:

1. **Read refactored story completely**
2. **Read CLAUDE.md** (coding standards)
3. **Read /docs/MIGRATION-WORKFLOW.md** (database migration rules)
4. **Start with Task 1** (Database schema)
5. **Follow tasks sequentially**
6. **Update Dev Agent Record** section as you go
7. **Run all tests** before marking "Review"

### For Existing Implementation:

**If parts of original story were already implemented:**

1. **Audit current code against refactored requirements**
2. **Identify what aligns with Google Docs model**
3. **Identify what needs refactoring (clone-based behavior)**
4. **Create sub-tasks for refactoring**
5. **Test extensively after refactoring**

**Critical Refactoring Needed:**
- If "Clone to My Vault" is required before editing â†’ REMOVE
- If shared docs don't appear in "Shared with Me" â†’ ADD
- If users can't edit original directly â†’ FIX permission checks
- If clone is mandatory â†’ Make it optional via context menu
