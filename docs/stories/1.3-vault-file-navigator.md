# Story 1.3: Multi-Folio Organization Structure

**Status:** Done

## User Story

As a user, I want to organize my work into multiple folios with a hierarchical structure of folders and notes, so that I can manage different projects and subjects separately.

## Description

This story implements the multi-folio organization structure, allowing users to create and manage multiple folios (previously called vaults), each containing a hierarchical structure of folders and notes. The implementation includes a comprehensive file navigator with full CRUD operations, context menus, and a folio switcher.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Users can create multiple folios to organize different projects/subjects
- [x] Each folio has its own hierarchical structure of folders and notes
- [x] The File Navigator displays the current folio's folder/note hierarchy
- [x] Users can create new folios, folders, and notes through dialog interfaces
- [x] Users can rename folios, folders, and notes inline or through dialogs
- [x] Users can delete folios, folders, and notes with confirmation
- [x] The Folio Switcher at the bottom allows switching between folios
- [x] Context menus provide quick access to actions (rename, delete)
- [x] The sidebar maintains responsive design and proper theming

## Tasks / Subtasks

#### Code Quality Assessment:

**Readability**: GOOD
- Component structure is logical and well-organized
- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Good use of TypeScript interfaces
- Consistent naming conventions

**Standards Compliance**: CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
- ❌ FileNavigator.tsx: 573 lines (EXCEEDS 250 line limit by 323 lines) - MUST BE REFACTORED
- ✅ All other components under 250 lines
- ✅ No hardcoded colors or spacing - all use CSS variables
- ✅ No 'any' types - proper TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Prisma singleton client used correctly (imported from @/lib/prisma)
- ✅ API routes have proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Proper use of Zod for validation
- ❌ CRITICAL: Database migration missing for Vault→Folio rename and Folder/Note table additions

**Performance**: GOOD
- Database queries use select to limit fields (e.g., folios/route.ts lines 23-29)
- Proper use of Prisma relations with cascade delete
- Zustand store efficiently manages state
- Recursive rendering optimized with proper React patterns

**Security**: EXCELLENT
- All API routes check authentication (auth() call in all routes)
- User ownership verified before CRUD operations
- Folio ownership checks (e.g., folders/route.ts lines 24-34)
- Proper cascade delete prevents orphaned data
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Cannot delete last folio (safety check)

**Testing**: NOT EVALUATED
- No test files found for this story (CLAUDE.md requires tests)
- Unit tests should be added for components
- Integration tests needed for API routes

#### Refactoring Performed:
