# Story 2.1: Highlight Menu Foundation

**Status:** Draft

## User Story

As a user, I want a menu to appear when I highlight text, so that I can see the available editing options.

## Description

This story implements the foundation for the highlight/transform menu that appears when users select text in the editor. This menu will serve as the interface for AI-powered text transformation features.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] When text is selected in the editor, a contextual menu appears near the selection
- [ ] The menu displays placeholder options for: Rephrase, Summarize, and Fix Grammar
- [ ] The menu is positioned intelligently to avoid going off-screen
- [ ] Clicking outside the menu or deselecting text closes the menu
- [ ] The menu has proper styling consistent with the design system
- [ ] The menu foundation is built to support adding functional AI features in subsequent stories
