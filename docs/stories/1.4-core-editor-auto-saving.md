# Story 1.4: Core Editor & Auto-Saving

**Status:** Draft

## User Story

As a user, I want to type text into a note and have it saved automatically, so that I never lose my work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The TipTap editor is integrated and functional in the main content area
- [ ] Users can type and edit text in the editor
- [ ] Content is automatically saved as the user types (debounced)
- [ ] A subtle indicator shows when content is being saved
