# Story 3.2: Collaborative Sharing & Permissions

**Status:** Approved

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Web Publishing Feature

**Dependencies:** Story 3.1 (Basic Page Publishing)

---

## User Story

As a user, I want to share my published pages with specific people via email with either read-only or edit permissions, so that collaborators can immediately access and work on the shared documents in their "Shared with Me" folio, just like Google Docs, enabling true collaborative content creation while maintaining control over access and ownership.

## Description

This story extends the existing web publishing feature (Story 3.1) with Google Docs-style collaborative sharing capabilities. The implementation follows a three-tiered access model:

**Level 1: Public Publishing (Currently Working - Story 3.1)**
- User publishes a page and it becomes a public microsite accessible to anyone
- NO login required
- Access: Anyone with the URL can view
- URL format: `https://edfolio.app/public/my-article-abc123`
- Status: ✅ Already implemented - DO NOT CHANGE

**Level 2: Share Read-Only via Email (NEW - THIS STORY)**
- User shares a published page with specific people via email for read-only access
- Authentication REQUIRED: Recipients must log in to Edfolio to view
- Access: Only invited email addresses can view the ORIGINAL document (with valid token + authentication)
- File Browser: Document appears IMMEDIATELY and AUTOMATICALLY in recipient's "Shared with Me" system folio
- Viewing: Recipients view the LIVE, ORIGINAL document (NOT a copy)
- URL format: `https://edfolio.app/public/my-article-abc123?token=secure-token`
- ❌ NO clone required - document is directly accessible

**Level 3: Share Edit via Email (NEW - THIS STORY)**
- User shares a published page with specific people via email for collaborative editing
- Authentication REQUIRED: Recipients must log in to Edfolio to edit
- Access: Only invited email addresses can edit the ORIGINAL document (with valid token + authentication)
- File Browser: Document appears IMMEDIATELY and AUTOMATICALLY in recipient's "Shared with Me" system folio
- Editing: Recipients edit the LIVE, ORIGINAL document collaboratively (NOT a copy)
- Permissions: Can edit content, see edit history, but cannot delete or change sharing settings
- URL format: `https://edfolio.app/public/my-article-abc123?token=secure-token`
- ❌ NO clone required - document is directly editable
- ✅ Changes save to original document, visible to all collaborators

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Authentication Gate**: Token-based shares (Levels 2 & 3) require authentication before granting access
2. **System "Shared with Me" Folio**: Created automatically on user signup, cannot be deleted or renamed
3. **Immediate Access Model**: Shared pages appear in recipient's "Shared with Me" folio as soon as share is created (if recipient has account) or when they first access the link
4. **Collaborative Editing**: Edit permission = direct editing of ORIGINAL document, NOT a copy
5. **Optional Clone Feature**: Clone is available via context menu but is separate from collaboration

**Key Functionality:**
- Email-based sharing invitations with permission levels (read-only, edit)
- Share link generation with unique access tokens
- Permission management UI (view, revoke, modify access)
- IMMEDIATE access to shared documents in "Shared with Me" system folio
- Direct collaborative editing of ORIGINAL documents for users with edit permissions
- Read-only users view ORIGINAL documents (not copies)
- Clone/duplicate feature as OPTIONAL, SEPARATE action (right-click context menu)
- Email notifications (invitation, permission changes, access revoked)
- GDPR-compliant invitation tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

### System Folio - "Shared with Me"
- [ ] "Shared with Me" system folio created AUTOMATICALLY on user account creation
- [ ] System folio has `isSystem: true` flag in database
- [ ] System folio cannot be deleted by user (returns 403 error)
- [ ] System folio cannot be renamed by user (returns 403 error)
- [ ] System folio appears in folio switcher above user's personal folios
- [ ] System folio has special icon (Users icon) to distinguish from regular folios
- [ ] Badge showing count of shared items in folio switcher
- [ ] All existing users get "Shared with Me" folio via migration script

### Sharing Levels & Authentication
- [ ] **Level 1: Public publishing works without authentication** (already implemented, do not change)
- [ ] Public pages accessible at `/public/[slug]` without query parameters
- [ ] No login required for public pages
- [ ] Public pages do NOT appear in anyone's "Shared with Me" folio
- [ ] **Level 2 & 3: Accessing `/public/[slug]?token=xxx` requires authentication**
- [ ] Unauthenticated users redirected to `/login?callbackUrl=...&token=...`
- [ ] Token preserved through login/signup flow
- [ ] After authentication, user redirected back to shared page with token
- [ ] Server validates both session AND token before granting access
- [ ] Invalid or expired tokens show appropriate error message

### Share Creation & Management
- [ ] User can share a published page via email with specified permission level (read or edit)
- [ ] System generates unique, cryptographically secure access tokens (256-bit)
- [ ] Email invitations sent via EU-based email service (Resend)
- [ ] Invitation emails contain properly encoded access link, permission level, and expiry date (optional)
- [ ] Share modal shows list of current collaborators with permission levels
- [ ] Page owner can view all current shares and their permission levels
- [ ] Page owner can revoke access at any time
- [ ] Page owner can modify permissions (read → edit, edit → read)
- [ ] Revoked access prevents further page access via the invitation link
- [ ] System tracks when each share was created and last accessed
- [ ] Permission changes trigger email notifications to affected users

### Immediate Access to Shared Documents
- [ ] **When share is created, document IMMEDIATELY appears in recipient's "Shared with Me" folio**
- [ ] If recipient exists: PageCollaborator record created instantly when share is created
- [ ] If recipient doesn't exist: PageCollaborator record created when they sign up and access link
- [ ] **NO user action required - document is automatically accessible**
- [ ] Shared page appears in "Shared with Me" folio with page title, sharer name, permission badge
- [ ] Documents remain in "Shared with Me" folio until share is revoked by owner
- [ ] Different permission badges displayed: "Can View", "Can Edit"
- [ ] Last accessed date displayed for each shared document

### Read-Only Sharing (VIEW ORIGINAL, NOT COPY)
- [ ] Read-only links require authentication (token + session)
- [ ] **Read-only users view the ORIGINAL, LIVE document (not a copy)**
- [ ] Read-only users cannot edit page content
- [ ] Read-only users cannot see unpublished changes
- [ ] Read-only access is tracked (view count per invitee)
- [ ] Read-only shared pages appear in "Shared with Me" folio with "Can View" badge
- [ ] Read-only users see updates made by owner and editors in real-time (or on refresh)
- [ ] No cloning required to view - direct access to original

### Edit Permissions (COLLABORATIVE EDITING OF ORIGINAL)
- [ ] **Users with edit permissions modify the ORIGINAL document directly**
- [ ] **NO cloning required - edits apply to the shared document**
- [ ] Changes are saved with author attribution
- [ ] All collaborators see the same live document
- [ ] Edit conflicts are handled gracefully (last-write-wins)
- [ ] Page owner sees list of recent editors
- [ ] Editors can see who else has edit access
- [ ] Opening shared document from "Shared with Me" folio opens the original in editor
- [ ] Editor shows permission level indicator ("Editor", "Viewer", "Owner")
- [ ] Multiple users can edit sequentially (future: real-time sync with operational transform)

### Clone Capability (OPTIONAL, SEPARATE FEATURE)
- [ ] **Clone is NOT required for collaboration - it's an optional action**
- [ ] **Clone accessed via right-click context menu on document in "Shared with Me" folio**
- [ ] Context menu shows: "Open", "Clone to My Folio", "Remove from list"
- [ ] Clone option available for shared pages (read or edit permissions)
- [ ] Clone requires user to be authenticated
- [ ] Clone creates INDEPENDENT copy in user's default folio
- [ ] Cloned page is private by default (not published, not shared)
- [ ] User becomes owner of cloned page
- [ ] Original shared page remains unchanged
- [ ] Cloned page retains formatting and content
- [ ] Clone is NOT collaborative - it's a separate, independent document
- [ ] After cloning, user has both: (1) access to shared original, (2) their own independent copy

### Security & Privacy (GDPR)
- [ ] All invitation data stored in UK/EU database (Railway Europe region)
- [ ] Email service uses EU-based infrastructure (Resend)
- [ ] Access tokens are cryptographically secure (256-bit)
- [ ] Tokens expire after configurable period (default: 90 days)
- [ ] Page owner can set expiry dates for shares
- [ ] No personally identifiable information stored beyond email addresses
- [ ] Users can request deletion of their invitation history

### User Experience
- [ ] Share modal accessible from publish settings or page menu
- [ ] **Copyable weblink prominently displayed at top of share modal** (like Notion)
- [ ] Copy button/icon next to URL that copies link to clipboard
- [ ] Visual feedback (toast/checkmark) when URL is copied
- [ ] URL field shows full public URL in readable format
- [ ] Clear visual distinction between public URL and shared links
- [ ] Collaborators list shows avatars, names, permission levels, last access
- [ ] Toast notifications for successful shares, permission changes, revocations
- [ ] Email preview shown before sending invitation

  - If exists, generate new token recursively
  - If unique, return token
  - Maximum 10 attempts, throw error if all fail
- [ ] Implement `verifyAccessToken(token: string): Promise<PageShare | null>`:
  - Query PageShare by accessToken
  - Check if status === 'active'
  - Check if expiresAt is null OR expiresAt > new Date()
  - If valid, update lastAccessedAt to now and increment accessCount
  - Return PageShare object or null if invalid
- [ ] Add TypeScript interfaces:
  ```typescript
  export interface TokenVerificationResult {
    valid: boolean;
    share?: PageShare;
    permission?: 'read' | 'edit';
    error?: string;
  }
  ```

  - Verify user is page owner (page.note.folioId matches user's folio)
  - Query all PageShare records where pageId matches
  - Include share metadata: invitedEmail, permission, status, createdAt, lastAccessedAt, accessCount
  - Return: `{ shares: PageShare[] }`
  - Error handling: 401, 403, 404, 500

  - Authenticate request
  - Parse request body: `{ invitedEmail, permission, expiresAt? }`
  - Validate email format
  - Verify page is published (return 400 if not)
  - Verify user is page owner
  - Check for existing active share with same email (return 409 if duplicate)
  - Generate access token using `generateAccessToken()`

  - Create PageShare record in database
  - **CRITICAL: Check if invitee has Edfolio account (query User by email)**
  - **If user exists:**
    - Create PageCollaborator record immediately
    - Link: `{ pageId, userId: invitee.id, shareId: share.id, role: permission === 'edit' ? 'editor' : 'viewer' }`
    - Document appears in their "Shared with Me" folio instantly
  - **If user doesn't exist:**

- [ ] Implement PATCH endpoint (update share permission or status):
  - Authenticate request
  - Verify user is page owner
  - Parse request body: `{ permission?, status? }`
  - Validate permission if provided: 'read' or 'edit'
  - Validate status if provided: 'active' or 'revoked'
  - Update PageShare record
  - **If permission changed:**
    - Update corresponding PageCollaborator record role ('viewer' or 'editor')
    - Send `sendPermissionChanged()` email
  - **If status changed to 'revoked':**
    - Delete corresponding PageCollaborator record
    - Document disappears from recipient's "Shared with Me" folio

- [ ] Keep file under 150 lines

### Task 7: Authentication Gate for Token-Based Access (2 hours)

- [ ] Update `/app/public/[slug]/page.tsx` (public page rendering)
- [ ] Add logic at top of component to check for token in query params:
  ```typescript
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const token = searchParams.get('token');
  ```
- [ ] If token is present:
  - Check if user is authenticated (getServerSession)
  - If NOT authenticated:
    - Redirect to: `/login?callbackUrl=${encodeURIComponent(`/public/${slug}?token=${token}`)}`
    - Preserve token in callbackUrl
    - Return redirect response
  - If authenticated:
    - Proceed to validate token (next task)
- [ ] If no token:
  - Proceed with public page rendering (Level 1: Public access)
  - No authentication required
- [ ] Test:
  - Accessing `/public/my-page?token=abc` without login redirects to login
  - After login, redirected back to `/public/my-page?token=abc`

### Task 8: Token Validation & First-Time Access Flow (3 hours)

- [ ] In `/app/public/[slug]/page.tsx`, after authentication gate:
- [ ] If token is present AND user is authenticated:
  - Call `verifyAccessToken(token)` to get PageShare
  - If PageShare is null (invalid/expired token):
    - Show error page: "This link is invalid or has expired"
    - Provide link to contact page owner
  - If PageShare is valid:
    - Verify `pageShare.pageId` matches current page
    - Verify `pageShare.invitedEmail` matches authenticated user's email
    - If mismatch: Show error "This link was sent to a different email address"
    - **Check if PageCollaborator record exists for (pageId, userId)**
    - **If NOT exists (first-time access):**
      - Create PageCollaborator record: `{ pageId, userId, shareId, role: permission === 'edit' ? 'editor' : 'viewer' }`
      - Document now appears in user's "Shared with Me" folio
      - Update PageShare lastAccessedAt and increment accessCount
    - **If exists (subsequent access):**
      - User is already a collaborator
      - No database changes needed (token not required anymore, but still works)
    - Proceed to render page with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Render page based on permission:
  - If permission === 'read': Show read-only view
  - If permission === 'edit': Show editable view (user can open in editor)
- [ ] Add banner at top: "Shared with you by [owner name] - [Permission level]"
- [ ] Test:
  - First access with valid token creates PageCollaborator
  - Document appears in "Shared with Me" folio
  - Subsequent access works without token
  - Invalid token shows error
  - Token for different email shows error

### Task 9: FileNavigator - Display "Shared with Me" Folio (3 hours)

- [ ] Update FileNavigator component (find location via Grep)
- [ ] Query user's "Shared with Me" system folio on component mount:
  - API call: `/api/folios?isSystem=true` or similar
  - Filter for folio with `isSystem: true` and name "Shared with Me"
- [ ] Display "Shared with Me" folio in folio switcher:
  - Position: Above user's personal folios
  - Icon: Users icon (or "UsersIcon" from lucide-react)
  - Badge: Show count of shared documents
  - Visual distinction: Different background color or border
- [ ] On selecting "Shared with Me" folio:
  - Query all PageCollaborator records for current user
  - For each, fetch associated PublishedPage and Page data

- [ ] Clicking a shared document:
  - If permission === 'viewer': Open in read-only view
  - If permission === 'editor': Open in editor for collaborative editing
  - Load ORIGINAL document (not a copy)
- [ ] Test:
  - "Shared with Me" folio appears in switcher
  - Shows all shared documents
  - Permission badges are correct
  - Clicking document opens original

### Task 10: Right-Click Context Menu for Clone (2 hours)

- [ ] Update FileNavigator to add context menu for documents in "Shared with Me" folio
- [ ] Create `/components/shared-with-me/SharedDocumentContextMenu.tsx`
- [ ] Implement context menu with options:

- [ ] Implement "Clone to My Folio" action:
  - Create API endpoint: `POST /api/pages/[pageId]/clone`
  - Authenticate request
  - Verify user has access (PageCollaborator exists)
  - Query original Page data
  - Create new Page in user's default folio (or selected folio)
  - Copy title and content
  - Set new owner to current user

  - Buttons: "Cancel", "Clone"
- [ ] On successful clone:
  - Show toast: "Page cloned successfully"
  - Optionally navigate to cloned page
- [ ] Keep cloning separate from collaboration:
  - Original shared page remains in "Shared with Me"
  - User can access both original and clone
  - Clone is independent document
- [ ] Test:
  - Right-click shows context menu
  - Clone creates independent copy
  - Clone is in user's folio, not shared
  - Original remains accessible

### Task 11: Collaborative Editing - Update Note Editing Permissions (2.5 hours)

- [ ] Find note editing API (likely `/app/api/notes/[noteId]/route.ts` PATCH method)
- [ ] Update permission check logic:
  - Current: Only allows editing if user owns the note (folioId matches user's folio)
  - **New: Allow editing if user owns note OR user has PageCollaborator record with role='editor'**
  - Query: `PageCollaborator.findFirst({ where: { pageId: note.publishedPageId, userId: session.user.id, role: 'editor' } })`
  - If found, user is authorized to edit

  - For now, track in PageCollaborator: update `lastAccessedAt` on each edit
- [ ] Update editor UI to show permission level:
  - Create `/components/editor/CollaborationBanner.tsx`
  - Display at top of editor if user is editing shared document
  - Show: "Editing as collaborator - Editor" or "Viewing as collaborator - Viewer"
  - Include page owner name
  - Use CSS variables for styling
- [ ] Add banner to editor page:
  - Check if current note has associated PageCollaborator for user
  - If yes, render CollaborationBanner
- [ ] Handle read-only view:
  - If user has 'viewer' role, disable editor
  - Show message: "You have view-only access to this document"
- [ ] Test:
  - User with 'editor' role can edit shared document
  - Changes save to original document
  - User with 'viewer' role cannot edit
  - Banner displays correct permission level
  - Page owner can still edit normally

### Task 12: Share Management UI - ShareManagementModal (4 hours)

- [ ] Create `/components/publish/ShareManagementModal.tsx`

## Dev Notes

### 🚨 CRITICAL: This Story Implements Google Docs-Style Sharing, NOT Clone-Based Sharing

**DO NOT implement a clone-based workflow.** This is the most critical requirement of this story.

**INCORRECT FLOW (DO NOT DO THIS):**
1. User receives email → clicks link
2. User views shared document
3. User clicks "Clone to My Vault" button
4. User edits their own copy
5. ❌ Original document unchanged - NOT collaborative

**CORRECT FLOW (DO THIS):**
1. User receives email → clicks link (or signs up/logs in)
2. Document IMMEDIATELY appears in "Shared with Me" folio
3. User opens document from "Shared with Me"
4. If "edit" permission: User edits ORIGINAL directly
5. If "read" permission: User views ORIGINAL (read-only)
6. ✅ Changes save to original, all collaborators see updates

**Clone is OPTIONAL and SEPARATE:**
- Accessed via right-click context menu
- Creates independent copy (not collaborative)
- User can have both: access to original + their own clone

---

### Architecture Overview

This story extends Story 3.1 (Basic Page Publishing) with collaborative sharing. The architecture is based on three distinct access levels:

**Three-Tiered Access Model:**

1. **Public Access (Level 1) - NO CHANGES**
   - URL: `/public/[slug]` (no token)
   - Authentication: None
   - Access: Anyone
   - Implementation: Already working from Story 3.1
   - DO NOT MODIFY

2. **Token-Based Read-Only (Level 2) - THIS STORY**
   - URL: `/public/[slug]?token=xxx`
   - Authentication: REQUIRED
   - Access: Only invited email addresses
   - Persistence: Appears in "Shared with Me" folio
   - Permission: View only, cannot edit
   - Viewing: ORIGINAL document, not a copy

3. **Token-Based Edit Access (Level 3) - THIS STORY**
   - URL: `/public/[slug]?token=xxx`
   - Authentication: REQUIRED
   - Access: Only invited email addresses
   - Persistence: Appears in "Shared with Me" folio
   - Permission: Can edit content
   - Editing: ORIGINAL document, collaborative

---

### Database Schema

**New Fields:**

1. **Folio Model - Add isSystem Field:**
   ```prisma
   model Folio {
     id        String   @id @default(cuid())
     name      String
     isSystem  Boolean  @default(false)  // NEW: Marks system folios
     // ... existing fields
   }
   ```

2. **PageShare Model (NEW):**
   - Stores invitation metadata
   - Links invited email to page
   - Contains access token
   - Tracks access statistics

3. **PageCollaborator Model (NEW):**
   - Links authenticated user to shared page
   - Created on first access with valid token
   - Determines what appears in "Shared with Me" folio
   - Stores permission level (viewer/editor)

**Key Relationships:**
- PageShare → PublishedPage (one share per invited email per page)
- PageCollaborator → User (one collaborator record per user per page)
- PageCollaborator → PageShare (nullable, links to original invitation)
- PageCollaborator → PublishedPage (which page user has access to)

---

### System "Shared with Me" Folio

**Critical Requirements:**

1. **Creation:**
   - Created automatically on user signup
   - Migration script needed for existing users
   - Utility function: `createSystemFoliosForUser(userId)`

2. **Properties:**
   - `isSystem: true` flag in database
   - Name: "Shared with Me" (constant)
   - Cannot be deleted (403 error)
   - Cannot be renamed (403 error)
   - Owned by user (ownerId field)

3. **Display:**
   - Appears in folio switcher above personal folios
   - Special icon (Users icon)
   - Badge with count of shared documents
   - Clear visual distinction from regular folios

4. **Contents:**
   - Shows all documents user has PageCollaborator record for
   - Each document displays:
     - Title
     - Owner name
     - Permission badge ("Can View" or "Can Edit")
     - Last accessed date
   - Documents appear IMMEDIATELY when share is created

---

### Authentication Gate Implementation

**Critical Flow:**

1. **Check for Token:**
   - Parse URL query params: `?token=xxx`
   - If no token: Render as public page (Level 1)
   - If token present: Proceed to authentication gate

2. **Authentication Check:**
   - Use NextAuth `getServerSession()` to check auth status
   - If NOT authenticated:
     - Redirect to: `/login?callbackUrl=/public/[slug]?token=[token]`
     - Preserve token through login flow
   - If authenticated: Proceed to validation

3. **Token Validation:**
   - Call `verifyAccessToken(token)`
   - Check PageShare exists, is active, not expired
   - Verify pageId matches current page
   - Verify invitedEmail matches user's email
   - If invalid: Show error page

4. **First-Time Access:**
   - Check if PageCollaborator exists for (pageId, userId)
   - If NOT exists:
     - Create PageCollaborator record
     - Document appears in "Shared with Me" folio
   - If exists: User already has access (subsequent visit)

5. **Render with Permissions:**
   - If permission === 'read': Read-only view
   - If permission === 'edit': Editable view

---

### Immediate Access Model (CRITICAL)

**How Documents Appear in "Shared with Me" Instantly:**

1. **When Share is Created (POST /api/pages/[pageId]/shares):**
   - System generates access token
   - Creates PageShare record
   - **Checks if invitee exists in database (query User by email)**
   - **If user exists:**
     - Creates PageCollaborator record IMMEDIATELY
     - Document appears in their "Shared with Me" folio RIGHT NOW
     - User can access document without clicking email link
   - **If user doesn't exist:**
     - PageCollaborator created when they sign up and access link
     - Document appears on first access

2. **FileNavigator Query:**
   - On load, query all PageCollaborator records for current user
   - For each, fetch associated PublishedPage data
   - Display in "Shared with Me" folio
   - No user action required

3. **No "Accept" or "Clone" Step:**
   - User never needs to click "Accept invitation"
   - User never needs to click "Clone to access"
   - Document is accessible immediately from folio switcher

---

### Collaborative Editing Implementation

**Permission Check for Editing:**

Current API endpoints likely check:
```typescript
// CURRENT (INCORRECT):
if (note.folioId !== userFolioId) {
  return 403 Forbidden;
}
```

Must update to:
```typescript
// NEW (CORRECT):
const isOwner = note.folioId === userFolioId;
const isCollaborator = await prisma.pageCollaborator.findFirst({
  where: {
    pageId: note.publishedPageId,
    userId: session.user.id,
    role: 'editor'
  }
});

if (!isOwner && !isCollaborator) {
  return 403 Forbidden;
}
```

**Editor UI Updates:**

1. **Collaboration Banner:**
   - Component: `/components/editor/CollaborationBanner.tsx`
   - Show when editing shared document
   - Display: "Editing as collaborator - Editor" or "Viewing as collaborator - Viewer"
   - Include owner name
   - Position: Top of editor

2. **Permission Indicator:**
   - Show user's role: "Owner", "Editor", "Viewer"
   - Visual indicator (badge/icon)

3. **Save Attribution (Future):**
   - Consider adding `lastEditedBy` to track who made last change
   - Show in edit history

---

### Clone as Optional Feature

**Context Menu Implementation:**

1. **Trigger:**
   - Right-click on document in "Shared with Me" folio
   - NOT the default action

2. **Menu Options:**
   - "Open" (default)
   - "Clone to My Folio"
   - "Remove from list"

3. **Clone Action:**
   - Shows confirmation dialog
   - Creates independent copy via POST `/api/pages/[pageId]/clone`
   - Copy appears in user's default folio
   - Copy is NOT published, NOT shared
   - User becomes owner of copy
   - Original shared document remains in "Shared with Me"

4. **After Cloning:**
   - User has access to TWO documents:
     - Original shared document (collaborative)
     - Independent clone (private)
   - Changes to clone DON'T affect original
   - Changes to original DON'T affect clone

---

### Email Service Integration

**Resend Configuration:**

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` - API key from Resend dashboard
   - `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@edfolio.app`
   - `EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Edfolio`

2. **Email Templates:**
   - Use React Email components (Resend's preferred format)
   - Create components in `/emails/` directory
   - Templates:
     - ShareInvitationEmail
     - PermissionChangedEmail
     - AccessRevokedEmail

3. **URL Encoding (CRITICAL):**
   - DO NOT pass complete URL to template
   - Pass components separately: `pageSlug` and `token`
   - Construct URL in template to avoid double-encoding
   - Example: `const url = \`${baseUrl}/public/${pageSlug}?token=${token}\``

4. **GDPR Compliance:**
   - Resend has EU infrastructure
   - All emails sent from EU servers
   - Verify in Resend dashboard settings

### Coding Standards Compliance

**CRITICAL - Must Follow CLAUDE.md:**

1. **CSS Variables:**
   - NO hardcoded colors: `className="bg-white"` ❌
   - USE CSS variables: `className="bg-background text-foreground"` ✅
   - Permission badges: `bg-accent text-accent-foreground`
   - System folio: `bg-muted border-border`

2. **File Length:**
   - Components: Max 250 lines
   - Utilities: Max 150 lines
   - API routes: Max 200 lines
   - If exceeded, split into sub-components

3. **TypeScript:**
   - NO `any` types
   - All functions have explicit return types
   - Use Prisma-generated types when possible
   - Define interfaces for component props

4. **Error Handling:**
   - ALL API routes wrapped in try-catch
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404, 409, 500)
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Log errors with descriptive messages

5. **Database Migrations:**
   - Follow `/docs/MIGRATION-WORKFLOW.md` EXACTLY
   - NEVER edit migration files after creation
   - ALWAYS run `npx prisma migrate status` before and after
   - Commit both schema.prisma AND migration files

6. **Package Manager:**
   - USE pnpm: `pnpm add resend` ✅
   - NOT npm: `npm install resend` ❌
   - Update pnpm-lock.yaml

7. **Testing:**
   - Test all acceptance criteria
   - Test edge cases
   - Test error states
   - Verify GDPR compliance (EU data residency)

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Clone-Based Workflow:**
   - ❌ Making users clone to collaborate
   - ✅ Direct access to original document

2. **Hardcoded Colors:**
   - ❌ `bg-blue-500 text-white`
   - ✅ `bg-accent text-accent-foreground`

3. **Missing Authentication Gate:**
   - ❌ Token-based shares accessible without login
   - ✅ Redirect to login, preserve token in callbackUrl

4. **Double URL Encoding:**
   - ❌ Passing complete URL to email template
   - ✅ Passing slug and token separately, construct in template

5. **System Folio Creation:**
   - ❌ Forgetting to create for existing users
   - ✅ Run migration script for all existing users

6. **Permission Checks:**
   - ❌ Only checking if user is owner
   - ✅ Check owner OR has PageCollaborator with 'editor' role

7. **File Length:**
   - ❌ 500-line component files
   - ✅ Split into smaller components under 250 lines

8. **Migration Workflow:**
   - ❌ Editing migration SQL after creation
   - ✅ Create new migration if changes needed

---

### Dependencies

**External Packages:**
- `resend` - Email service SDK (EU-based infrastructure)

**Internal Dependencies:**

   - Operational Transform for simultaneous editing
   - Live cursor positions
   - User presence indicators

2. **Advanced Permissions:**
   - "Can Comment" role (between read and edit)
   - Granular permissions (can edit but not delete)

3. **Share Analytics:**
   - Track who viewed/edited and when
   - Edit history with author attribution
   - Activity timeline

4. **Notification System:**
   - In-app notifications for share invitations

5. **Bulk Sharing:**
   - Share multiple pages at once
   - Share entire folios

6. **Link Expiry:**
   - Configurable expiry dates
   - Auto-revoke after expiry

---

### Questions for Clarification (If Any)

If you encounter ambiguity during implementation:

1. Should system folio be deletable by admin/super-user? (Assume: NO, never deletable)
2. Should clone inherit tags/metadata from original? (Assume: YES, copy everything except ownership)
3. Should revoked users see notification in "Shared with Me"? (Assume: NO, document just disappears)
4. Should we support sharing unpublished pages? (Assume: NO, only published pages can be shared)
5. What happens if page is unpublished while shared? (Assume: Shares remain, become active when re-published)

**If unsure, document in story and ask before proceeding.**

#### Refactoring Performed During QA:

Three critical build errors were identified and FIXED during QA validation:

1. **SharedDocumentContextMenu.tsx** - React ESLint compliance
   - ISSUE: Unescaped quotes in JSX causing `react/no-unescaped-entities` errors
   - FIX: Changed `"` to `&quot;` and `'` to `&apos;`
   - LINES: 123, 126

2. **app/api/notes/[id]/clone/route.ts** - Prisma schema field name
   - ISSUE: Used `publishedPage` instead of `published` (Prisma field name)
   - FIX: Updated all references to use correct `published` field name
   - LINES: 30, 49, 51, 53
   - ALSO: Removed unused import `verifyAccessToken`

3. **app/api/pages/[pageId]/shares/route.ts** - Zod & type validation
   - ISSUE 1: Invalid `required_error` parameter in z.enum()
   - FIX 1: Removed `required_error` from enum definition
   - LINE: 10
   - ISSUE 2: Type mismatch - expiryDate expected Date but received string
   - FIX 2: Added conversion `expiresAt ? new Date(expiresAt) : undefined`
   - LINE: 198

**All fixes maintain original functionality** - changes are type safety and lint compliance only.

#### Architecture Compliance:

**✅ CRITICAL: Google Docs-Style Collaborative Editing Verified**

The implementation correctly follows the REFACTORED specification:

1. ✅ **Direct Editing**: Users with 'editor' permission edit the ORIGINAL document
   - Evidence: `/app/api/notes/[id]/route.ts` allows editing for PageCollaborator with role='editor'

2. ✅ **NO Clone Required**: Collaboration does NOT require cloning
   - Evidence: Clone is separate optional feature in context menu

3. ✅ **Immediate Access**: Documents appear instantly in "Shared with Me" folio
   - Evidence: PageCollaborator created immediately when share is created for existing users

4. ✅ **Read-Only Views Original**: Viewers see the live, original document
   - Evidence: `/app/public/[slug]/page.tsx` renders actual published content

5. ✅ **System Folio**: Cannot be deleted or renamed
   - Evidence: API routes return 403 for system folio operations

#### Manual Testing Checklist:

**CRITICAL - Must Test Before Production:**
- [ ] New user signup creates "Shared with Me" folio automatically
- [ ] System folio cannot be deleted (returns 403)
- [ ] System folio cannot be renamed (returns 403)
- [ ] Share published page with existing user → appears in "Shared with Me" immediately
- [ ] Share published page with new email → email sent, collaborator created on first access
- [ ] Unauthenticated access with token redirects to login
- [ ] After login with token, user is redirected back and granted access
- [ ] User with 'editor' permission can edit shared document
- [ ] Changes by editor save to original document
- [ ] User with 'viewer' permission cannot edit (read-only)
- [ ] Context menu shows clone option on right-click
- [ ] Clone creates independent copy in user's folio
- [ ] Owner can change permissions via ShareManagementModal
- [ ] Owner can revoke access → document disappears from "Shared with Me"

**IMPORTANT - Error Handling:**
- [ ] Invalid token shows error message
- [ ] Expired token shows error message
- [ ] Token for different email shows error message
- [ ] Duplicate email invitation returns 409 error
- [ ] Sharing unpublished page returns 400 error

**NICE TO HAVE - Polish:**
- [ ] Permission badges display correctly
- [ ] Collaboration banner shows in editor
- [ ] Toast notifications work
- [ ] Copy link button copies URL to clipboard
- [ ] Email notifications sent (invitation, permission change, revocation)

#### Known Issues:

**NONE** - All critical and blocking issues have been resolved.

#### Future Enhancements (Post-Story):

The following enhancements are recommended for future stories:
